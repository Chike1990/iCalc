# iCalc
## Pseudocode
- create the basic structure in html: the display area, the buttons for the digits, the functions, and the operators.
- add a general class to the buttons, add more classes to the functions buttons and operators buttons to give them their unique class styles in JS.
- add a class name to distinguish each button later when adding functionality or  unique style.
- style the calculator.
- add the expected functionalities to the calc
  - select all the buttons and attach event listeners to them
  - display every button clicked on the display area
  - write functions to note what happens when the operator, functions and equal to buttons are clicked... use switch statement or other conditional expression to control what happens when a function/operator/equalto is clicked
- test that the icalc works as expected
